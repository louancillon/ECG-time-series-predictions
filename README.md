# ECG-time-series-predictions

This project involves multi-class time series classification, where we categorize ECG signals into three distinct classes. The dataset contained ECG measurements of varying classes with imbalances and differing lengths. We employed various techniques to extract features for classification, such as autocorrelation, average, and power for each ECG signal. Additionally, we extracted 15 FFT coefficients, computed heartbeats using biosspy, created characteristic averages for each patient, and extracted a range of features after normalization, including wave energy, peak locations (T, S, P, R, Q), intervals (ST, QRS, PR), and various ratios (QRS/T and QRS/P), as well as statistics like median, mean, and amplitude interval.

Moreover, we utilized db2 coefficients, and biosspy provided peak locations, timings, and heartbeat details. We calculated statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for these features and differences in peak timings, a crucial feature for distinguishing noise, normal heart rate, and abnormal heart rhythms. With these features, we trained a GradientBoosting model, fine-tuning it through Cross-validation grid search, resulting in a mean score of 0.817 in cross-validation.
